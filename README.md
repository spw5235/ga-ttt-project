## General Description

The goal of this project was to create a SPA in which a game of Tic-Tac-Toe could please played seamlessly without the inconvenience of having to reload a page.  The general features of this SPA are the following:

-   The ability to create an account and to saves performances.
-   The capability to play the game in a responsive and fluid environment.

## Technologies Used

This SPA utilizes the following technologies

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Pure JavaScript
-   jQuery
-   Ajax
-   NPM and Grunt for deployment

## Document Planning

In constructing this SPA, my primary intention was to utilize as many functions as possible in development.  In order to determine sequence of events, I envisioned myself as the user and each step that would take place as the game progressed.  Through this method, I was able to consider various options at certain stages during the game.  Then, by combining the number of short and simple JavaScript functions, the entire game could be put together.

## Unsolved Problems

There are some problems with this SPA that require further attention.  For instance, when attempting to play the game, one must first login.  However, there are problems if the user immediately starts playing the game without logging in first.  The temporary solution was to create a "dummy" board that is not linked to the server.  Then, after the user logs in, the functional board replaces the dummy board.  The same occurs with the "new game" button.

## User Stories

User stories were used in the construction of this application.  This ensures that the user interaction is optimized.  The following is a sample of user stories that were considered in the production of the application.

1. As a user, I would like to monitor my previous scores in the game.
2. As a user, I would like the game to be compatible with all devices.
3. As a user, I would like the webpage setup to be fluid and responsive.
4. As a user, I would like to navigate through the web application seamlessly.
